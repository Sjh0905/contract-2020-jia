It is a decentralized network protocol, with its correspondence being conducted by mutual data exchange between communication modules installed in these machines, like BlE and Wifi. In the Mesh Network, every machine, such as mobile phone, refrigerator, automobile, cash register and robot, can be a node. And these nodes could communicate with each other without the traditional internet, because MTC is a totally-decentralized Mesh Network protocol. For blockchain network and IoT of new generation, MTC Mesh Network is the foundation. That is, once MTC Mesh Network is built, all blockchain projects and IoT machines can exchange information and make transactions rapidly and conveniently, even offline. MTC can support all blockchain projects, including Bitcoin, Ethereu, EOS, Qtum and Achain, to enable them to shift value and enable IoT equipment to transfer data. In this way, network congestion caused by large qualities of transactions is unblocked; IoT does not need build costly private network to transmit data. In short, it will become the mainstream network for decentralized near field communication and the IoT.'
